# Hyperparameter Tuning Examples with Random Forest on Iris Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates different methods for hyperparameter tuning using a Random Forest classifier on the Iris dataset. The methods covered include:

1. Grid Search Cross-Validation
2. Random Search Cross-Validation
3. Bayesian Optimization with Hyperopt

## Contents
