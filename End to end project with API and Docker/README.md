Let's go through a step-by-step example of using an API to serve a machine learning prediction model. We'll use FastAPI to create a RESTful API for a prediction model, and for the example, we'll use a simple Iris flower classification model.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Train and Save the Model
First, let's train a simple machine learning model using the Iris dataset and save the trained model to a file.

Install Required Libraries

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib

```
